# Convolutional_Neural_Network_MNIST
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), and the goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the digit in each image.
## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is included in the Keras library and can be loaded using the keras.datasets.mnist module. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The extracted features are then flattened and passed through fully connected layers to perform classification.
